# FrosthavenAssistant

## What is it?
A helper app for the boardgames Gloomhaven, Frosthaven and any derivative.
The aim is to be a good replacement for the Gloomhaven Helper by Esoteric Software that is no longer available.
The focus is on good user experience, and to be like a boardgame component rather than a typical material style app.
That means most of the functionality will be in one single screen, which makes it seem slightly busy at first glance, but is really necessary to minimize need for user input which is a key factor to good UX for a boargame component.

This is also my attempt at learning the Flutter framework.
